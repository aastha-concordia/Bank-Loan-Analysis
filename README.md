An interactive Dashboard of a bank aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help to make data-driven decisions, track the loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform the lending strategies. The Bank Loan report is
created using
Time-intelligence functions (DAX), Data Modelling, various KPIs and Visualization etc. in Power BI

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive Loan Report Dashboard that visualizes critical metrics for a lending portfolio. Through three key sections—Summary, Overview, and Details—the dashboard offers actionable insights for financial analysts and decision-makers.

* Summary Section: Highlights monthly and year-to-date metrics, such as total loan applications, funded amounts, amounts received, average interest rate, and debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. This provides a quick snapshot of portfolio performance and growth trends, helping to monitor progress and identify areas needing attention.

* Overview Section: Breaks down the portfolio by various categories, including loan purpose, state, loan grade, and customer risk classification. This segmentation allows users to filter and analyze loans based on purpose (e.g., debt consolidation, credit card refinancing), state distribution, and risk level (Good vs. Bad Loans), enhancing risk assessment and portfolio diversity.

* Details Section: Presents granular data for each loan, including individual loan IDs, purpose, grade, funded amounts, received amounts, interest rates, and DTI ratios. This section supports in-depth analysis of each loan’s health, repayment status, and geographic trends.
The report reveals strong growth in loan applications and funding, with significant MOM increases across all key metrics. Good loans dominate, contributing most to the funded and received amounts. There’s also a noticeable correlation between loan term length and funded amounts. Lastly, regional and employee length analyses offer further segmentation for targeted strategies.

These insights could help in making data-driven decisions regarding loan approval strategies, risk management, and customer segmentation for optimized lending performance.
