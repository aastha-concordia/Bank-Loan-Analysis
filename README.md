# Bank-Loan-Analysis
An interactive Dashboard of a bank aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help to make data-driven decisions, track the loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform the lending strategies. The Bank Loan report is
created using
Time-intelligence functions (DAX), Data Modelling, various KPIs and Visualization etc. in Power BI

## Insights
This project provides a comprehensive Loan Report Dashboard that visualizes critical metrics for a lending portfolio. 
Through three key sections—Summary, Overview, and Details—the dashboard offers actionable insights for financial analysts and decision-makers.

* Summary Section: Highlights monthly and year-to-date metrics, such as total loan applications, funded amounts, amounts received, average interest rate, and debt-to-income (DTI) ratio.
   This provides a quick snapshot of portfolio performance and growth trends, helping to monitor progress and identify areas needing attention.

* Overview Section: Breaks down the portfolio by various categories, including loan purpose, state, loan grade, and customer risk classification.
   This segmentation allows users to filter and analyze loans based on purpose (e.g., debt consolidation, credit card refinancing), state distribution, and risk level (Good vs.
   Bad Loans), enhancing risk assessment and portfolio diversity.

* Details Section: Presents granular data for each loan, including individual loan IDs, purpose, grade, funded amounts, received amounts, interest rates, and DTI ratios.
   This section supports in-depth analysis of each loan’s health, repayment status, and geographic trends.
The report reveals strong growth in loan applications and funding, with significant MOM increases across all key metrics. Good loans dominate, contributing most to the funded and received amounts.
 There’s also a noticeable correlation between loan term length and funded amounts. Lastly, regional and employee length analyses offer further segmentation for targeted strategies.

These insights could help in making data-driven decisions regarding loan approval strategies, risk management, and customer segmentation for optimized lending performance.

## Recommendations


* Target Debt Consolidation and Credit Card Loans for Marketing:
  Since a significant portion of loans is used for debt consolidation and credit card repayment, consider offering tailored products or incentives for these categories.
  Marketing efforts could focus on states with higher application volumes (e.g., CA, NY, TX), which may lead to increased market share in these regions.

*  Monitor High-Risk Loans Closely:
   Implement stricter monitoring and collections for loans classified as “Bad Loans” and those with lower grades (like C).
   Developing a proactive strategy for identifying at-risk accounts could reduce default rates and improve the portfolio's overall health.

* Optimize Interest Rates to Stay Competitive:
   With a slight decrease in the average interest rate, continue analyzing competitor rates to maintain competitiveness, especially for higher-quality borrowers.
   Consider offering reduced rates or flexible terms for high-quality loans (grades A and B) to retain reliable customers.

*  Expand Loan Offerings in High-Demand Regions:
   Based on the state distribution insights, consider allocating more resources or specialized loan officers to regions with high demand (e.g., California, Texas).
   Regional data can also support tailored loan products that address specific financial needs of customers in those areas.

* Encourage Financial Health Among Borrowers:

   Promote financial wellness programs for customers, particularly those with higher DTI ratios, to prevent future delinquencies.
   By offering educational resources on managing DTI, customers may improve their financial standing, reducing loan risk and enhancing repayment rates.

*  Explore Opportunities for Portfolio Diversification:

   While debt consolidation is a dominant loan purpose, explore opportunities to diversify the loan portfolio into other areas, such as small business loans or home improvements,
      depending on market demand and risk    tolerance.
   This can protect against risks associated with over-concentration in specific loan categories.
