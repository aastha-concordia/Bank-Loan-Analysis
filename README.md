# Bank-Loan-Analysis
An interactive Dashboard of a bank aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help to make data-driven decisions, track the loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform the lending strategies. The Bank Loan report is
created using
Time-intelligence functions (DAX), Data Modelling, various KPIs and Visualization etc. in Power BI

## Insights
Loan Application Volume:

*    The total number of loan applications stands at 38.6K, with a Month-to-Date (MTD) increase of 4.3% and a Month-over-Month (MoM) growth of 6.9%.
*    This upward trend suggests a growing demand for loans, which could indicate favorable market conditions or increased customer interest in credit.
    
Funded vs. Received Amounts:

*    The Total Funded Amount is $435.8M, while the Total Amount Received is $473.1M. 
    This implies that received amounts slightly exceed funded amounts, which may be due to interest and other fees.
*    Month-over-month (MoM) growth for the funded amount is 13%, and for the received amount, it is 15.8%
    The higher increase in received amounts suggests effective loan repayment collection.

Interest Rate and Debt-to-Income (DTI) Trends:

 *   The Average Interest Rate is 12.0%, with a slight 3.5% MoM decrease, indicating a possible adjustment in loan interest policies or a more competitive market.
 *   The Average DTI ratio stands at 13.3%, with a 2.7% MoM decrease.
    This could mean that customers are taking on slightly less debt relative to their income, suggesting healthier financial conditions for borrowers.

Good Loans:
*    33K applications classified as good loans, funding $370M and receiving $436M.
*    Represents 86% of the total loans issued.

Bad Loans:
*   5K applications classified as bad loans, funding $66M and receiving $37M.
*   Represents 14% of the total loans issued.

Loan Purposes and State Distribution:

*    Common loan purposes include debt consolidation, credit card payments, and home improvement. 
     Debt consolidation is the most frequent purpose, implying that many customers are using loans to manage or reduce existing debt.
*    Loans are distributed across various states, with specific states like CA, NY, and TX having notable representation.
     The regional spread can help identify areas with higher credit demand, which may inform strategic expansion or marketing efforts.

Grade and Risk Levels:

*    Loans are assigned grades (A, B, C, etc.), which likely indicate risk levels, with A being the highest quality or lowest risk.
*    Most loans fall within the A and B grades, suggesting that the portfolio has a relatively low to moderate risk profile.

## Recommendations


* Target Debt Consolidation and Credit Card Loans for Marketing:
  Since a significant portion of loans is used for debt consolidation and credit card repayment, consider offering tailored products or incentives for these categories.
  Marketing efforts could focus on states with higher application volumes (e.g., CA, NY, TX), which may lead to increased market share in these regions.

*  Monitor High-Risk Loans Closely:
   Implement stricter monitoring and collections for loans classified as “Bad Loans” and those with lower grades (like C).
   Developing a proactive strategy for identifying at-risk accounts could reduce default rates and improve the portfolio's overall health.

* Optimize Interest Rates to Stay Competitive:
   With a slight decrease in the average interest rate, continue analyzing competitor rates to maintain competitiveness, especially for higher-quality borrowers.
   Consider offering reduced rates or flexible terms for high-quality loans (grades A and B) to retain reliable customers.

*  Expand Loan Offerings in High-Demand Regions:
   Based on the state distribution insights, consider allocating more resources or specialized loan officers to regions with high demand (e.g., California, Texas).
   Regional data can also support tailored loan products that address specific financial needs of customers in those areas.

* Encourage Financial Health Among Borrowers:

   Promote financial wellness programs for customers, particularly those with higher DTI ratios, to prevent future delinquencies.
   By offering educational resources on managing DTI, customers may improve their financial standing, reducing loan risk and enhancing repayment rates.

*  Explore Opportunities for Portfolio Diversification:

   While debt consolidation is a dominant loan purpose, explore opportunities to diversify the loan portfolio into other areas, such as small business loans or home improvements,
      depending on market demand and risk    tolerance.
   This can protect against risks associated with over-concentration in specific loan categories.
